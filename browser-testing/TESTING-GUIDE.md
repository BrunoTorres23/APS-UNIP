# Cross-Browser Testing Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for testing the Tecnologia e Sustentabilidade website across different browsers.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the following browsers:
  - Google Chrome (latest version)
  - Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
  - Microsoft Edge (latest version)
  - Safari (if on macOS/iOS)
  - Internet Explorer 11 (if on Windows)
  - Mobile browsers (Chrome for Android, Safari for iOS)

## Testing Process

### 1. Automated Feature Detection

1. Open the website in each browser
2. Add `?browser-test=true` to the URL (e.g., `index.html?browser-test=true`)
3. A testing panel will appear in the bottom right corner
4. Click "Run All Tests" to check browser feature support
5. Click "Export Results" to download a JSON file with the test results
6. Save the results file with a name that includes the browser and version (e.g., `chrome-115-windows.json`)

### 2. Manual Testing

1. Open the website in each browser
2. Add `?manual-test=true` to the URL (e.g., `index.html?manual-test=true`)
3. A testing panel will appear on the right side of the screen
4. Fill in the browser information (should be auto-detected)
5. Go through each test item and mark as Pass or Fail
6. Add notes for any issues found
7. Click "Export Test Results" to download a Markdown report
8. Save the report in the `browser-testing/results` directory

### 3. Visual Testing Checklist

For each browser, check the following:

- [ ] Layout is consistent with the design
- [ ] Typography renders correctly
- [ ] Colors appear as expected
- [ ] Images load properly
- [ ] Responsive design works at different screen sizes
- [ ] Sidebar opens and closes correctly
- [ ] Theme toggle works (light/dark mode)
- [ ] Animations and transitions are smooth
- [ ] Forms and interactive elements work correctly

### 4. Functional Testing Checklist

For each browser, verify:

- [ ] Navigation links work correctly
- [ ] Content loads properly
- [ ] Lazy loading of images works
- [ ] Service worker registers (check browser console)
- [ ] Offline functionality works (if supported)
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Forms submit correctly
- [ ] Interactive elements respond to user input

### 5. Performance Testing

For each browser:

- [ ] Measure page load time (use browser dev tools)
- [ ] Check for any rendering delays
- [ ] Verify smooth scrolling
- [ ] Test with throttled network conditions
- [ ] Check memory usage for any leaks

## Reporting Issues

When you find an issue:

1. Take a screenshot of the problem
2. Note the exact browser, version, and platform
3. Document the steps to reproduce the issue
4. Export a test report using the manual testing tool
5. Create an issue in the project repository with all the information

## Fixing Common Issues

### Internet Explorer 11

- If flexbox layouts are broken, check browser-fixes.css for IE11-specific fixes
- If CSS variables don't work, ensure fallback values are provided
- If JavaScript errors occur, verify the bundle.js fallback is loading

### Safari

- If fixed positioning doesn't work as expected, try alternative positioning
- If form elements look different, check for -webkit-appearance issues
- If scrolling is problematic, test with -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch

### Mobile Browsers

- If elements with 100vh height are cut off, use -webkit-fill-available
- If touch events don't work properly, test with both click and touch events
- If fixed elements jump during scrolling, adjust positioning strategy

```
